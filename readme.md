-GoogleReader-NodeJS-API
-=======================
-
-This is a migration from Tibfib Google Reader JS API
- It has become more a server implementantion, to provide an API for your developments, 
- easier to use than GReader one. So all the bussiness logic is encapsulated here, and
- the only thing you need to do is use this API to Login/getFeeds/addFeeds/... without having
- to think about what parameters does google need.
-
-- It uses the following Node JS modules:
-  http
-  https
-  formidable
-  request
-  express framework
-  
-- It uses the following JS libraries
-  underscore
-  underscore.string
-  
-Currently working on it, now just handles the responses from Google Reader API.
-TODOS:
-- Clean code
-- Make requests/responses work outside the box (now it is just printing responses to local txt files)
-- Create a front to test the API
-- Refactor again
