GoogleReader-NodeJS-API
=======================

This is a migration from Tibfib Google Reader JS API
 It has become more a server implementantion, to provide an API for your developments, 
 easier to use than GReader one. So all the bussiness logic is encapsulated here, and
 the only thing you need to do is use this API to Login/getFeeds/addFeeds/... without having
 to think about what parameters does google need.

-- It uses the following Node JS modules:
-  http
-  https
-  formidable
-  request
-  express framework

-- It uses the following JS libraries
- underscore
- underscore.string

-- TODOS:
- Clean code
- Create a front to test the API
- Refactor again
- Remove unhelpfull node modules
