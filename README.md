GoogleReader-NodeJS-API
=======================

This is a migration from Tibfib Google Reader JS API

- It uses the following Node JS modules:
  http
  https
  formidable
  request
  fs* (just now)
  
- It uses the following JS libraries
  underscore
  underscore.string
  
Currently working on it, now just handles the responses from Google Reader API.
TODOS:
- Clean code
- Make requests/responses work outside the box (now it is just printing responses to local txt files)
- Create a front to test the API
- Refactor again
